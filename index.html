	<h1>About The Story</h1>
  	<p>
    How the animation was supposed to go was, Tiny Timmy is just hanging around when (DUN DUN DUNNNNN) Mr. Mean, his teacher, walks up to him carrying a big stack of homework and drops it on Timmy and walks off. after timmy completes the homework and climbs out of the pile, (DUN DUN DUNNNNN) Mr. Mean is already standing there with another stack of homework and drops it on him again, this was supposed to be a stop motion loop but then we were told that we couldn't do stop motion and we could do a motorized storybox but, before we decided how to make the story in moterized storyboxform , we were told that we were a zoetrope team so we scrambled to make clay models for every frame but we couldnt get it done in time so the project isnt finished :(
